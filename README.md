# Real-time Object Detection Web App

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the Real-time Object Detection Web App! This project leverages the power of TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model to bring object detection right to your browser. No installations, no downloads – just open the webpage and start detecting objects in real-time using your webcam.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Real-time object detection using your device's camera
- 🖼️ Visual bounding boxes around detected objects
- 🏷️ Object labels with confidence scores
- 📊 List of uniquely detected objects with timestamps
- 🌐 Runs entirely in the browser – no server-side processing required

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The app uses TensorFlow.js to load the COCO-SSD (Common Objects in Context - Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model.
2. It accesses your device's camera feed (with your permission).
3. The video stream is analyzed in real-time to detect objects.
4. Detected objects are outlined with bounding boxes and labeled on the video feed.
5. A list of unique objects detected is maintained and displayed, showing when each object was first spotted.

## 🚀 Getting Started
